Development Notes:
==================
things to do:

@ lecture 119

	have enemies test for active player before droppping bombs?

	complete object pooling for: projectiles, effects?

	the Sky def. needs to be redone for OCD-TIDY but seems to be 100% nominal at this point.
		modify CloudFlow to support a notion of near or far for the micro-clouds... keep near ones low and far ones high when pooling

	fix formation motion - still working out squelch for delta motion

	??? take player health out of level manager and put in player

	optimize collision layers
	tidy IDE
	tidy C#
	tidy interface

	animate extra ships?
	drop health
	drop power-ups / after giving a power-up ability...., duh :)
	create my own art assets

	fix singleton (menuing) issue with levelmanager destroying | losing links on scene reloads
