Development Notes:
==================
things to do:

@ lecture 119

	have enemies test for active player before droppping bombs?

	I think I've managed to rebuild the scene, and glue all the parts back together....
	the Sky def. needs to be redone for OCD-TIDY but seems to be 100% nominal at this point.

	fix formation motion - still working out squelch for delta motion

	do i need to prefab a 'position' with an enemy in it to get past this webGL bug? TODO test if WebGL works now that it's a fresh new project


	??? take player health out of level manager and put in player

	optimize collision layers
	tidy IDE
	tidy C#
	tidy interface

	animate extra ships?
	drop health
	drop power-ups / after giving a power-up ability...., duh :)
	create my own art assets
	double-check that there is consistent audio when enemy && player weapons fire && hit
	fix singleton (menuing) issue with levelmanager destroying | losing links on scene reloads
