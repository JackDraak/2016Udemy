Development Notes:
==================
things to do:

@ lecture 119

	fix formation motion - still working out squelch for delta motion

	?? put wave counter into level manager? probably a good idea, esp. if oyu want diff. formations, or somesuch

	??? take player health out of level manager and put in player

	tidy IDE
	tidy C#
	tidy interface

	animate extra ships?
	drop health
	drop power-ups / after giving a power-up ability...., duh :)
	create my own art assets
	double-check that there is consistent audio when enemy && player weapons fire && hit
	fix singleton (menuing) issue with levelmanager destroying | losing links on scene reloads
