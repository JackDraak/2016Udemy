Development Notes:
==================
things to do:

@ lecture 117 - sound effects

	animate extra ships?
	drop health
	drop power-ups / after giving a power-up ability...., duh :)

	create my own art assets

	double-check that there is consistent audio when enemy && player weapons fire && hit

	enemy formation now moving in fixedUpdate - does this fully resomve issues around
		framerate independence? I believe so....

	fix singleton (menuing) issue with levelmanager destroying | losing links on scene reloads
