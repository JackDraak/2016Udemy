	things to do:

		@ lecture 117 - sound effects



		animate extra ships
		drop health
		drop power-ups / after giving a power-up ability...., duh :)

		double-check that there is consistent audio when enemy && player weapons fire && hit

		enemy formation now moving in fixedUpdate - does this fully resomve issues around
			framerate independence? I believe so....

		fix singleton (menuing) issue with levelmanager destroying | losing links on scene reloads
