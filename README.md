Ben Tristem via Udemy - Unity5 and C# - https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/

I'm not a paying GitHub member at this time so I can't make this private, but can't imagine it would be of much interest to anyone... I'm just running through the course from the top again to re-familiarize myself with C# and Unity.

At any rate, feel free to poke around!
